# Redialer

Updated version of win8-redialer made by Ankit Sharma

Microsoft has removed the redial options from the dial up connection settings in Windows 8 , it redials only when the first dial up connection fails,  not after other successive disconnections as it used to happen in previous versions of windows. So, I have developed this little application so that it keeps my 3G connection alive.

### How to Use:

1) Start the application  
2) Select the connection from the list and press Start  
3) Minimize the application, it will redial automatically if connection drops.  

### Notes for Windows 8.1 (Update Feb 2020: Haven't tested this.):

1) Use compatibility mode to run.  
2) Auto Start with windows wont work.
